# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Consumer Finance Company:


Project Name: Loan Default Analysis

Description:
This project aims to analyze loan default patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The dataset provided contains information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted or not. The goal is to identify patterns indicating the likelihood of default and understand the factors influencing loan defaults.

Problem Statement:
The consumer finance company needs to make informed decisions about loan approvals to minimize financial losses. By analyzing customer and loan attributes, the company aims to identify risky applicants and reduce credit loss.

Business Understanding:

The company faces two types of risks: approving a loan to a defaulter and rejecting a loan to a potential borrower.
Business decisions include loan acceptance (fully paid, current, charged-off) or rejection based on applicant profiles.
The objective is to understand the drivers behind loan defaults to improve portfolio and risk assessment.
Data Understanding:

The dataset contains loan data from 2007 to 2011.
Variables include borrower and loan attributes.
The data dictionary provides descriptions of the variables.
Approach:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate Analysis: Explore distributions of individual variables.
Bivariate Analysis: Understand relationships between variables and loan defaults.
Multivariate Analysis: Identify complex interactions and patterns.
Insights and Recommendations:
Summarize key findings and insights.
Provide recommendations for risk mitigation and loan approval criteria refinement.
Visualization:
Present visualizations in Python to support analysis findings.
Presentation:
Create a presentation summarizing the problem statement, analysis approach, results of univariate, bivariate analysis, etc., in business terms.
Include relevant visualizations and highlight important insights.
Expected Results:

Well-commented Python file containing code for analysis and insights.
Presentation in PDF format with problem statement, analysis approach, results, and visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook documenting thought process, code, and plots.
Folder Structure:

Data: Contains the loan dataset and data dictionary.
Notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebook with code and analysis (EDA case study.ipynb).
Presentation: Contains the PDF presentation file.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project, instructions, and important information.
